Lab 2
Open up JBDS (or have open)
Using same labs project
JBDS is ready

To configure new cache
open up JDG_Server/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml
Add the following:
	<local-cache name="HotRodcache" start="EAGER"/>
Start the JDG server
In server log (JDG_Server/standalone/log/server.log) you should see the name of your cache as being enabled

Back in JBDS, you will fill in the following methods
	addFivePiecesOfNewData
		remoteCache.put....
	tryToModifyExisting
		remoteCache.put ...
		remoteCache.putIfAbsent
		remoteCache.replace
	addFivePiecesOfNewDataAsynch
		Future set
		remoteCache.putAsynch
	removeCache
		remoteCache.clear
		
To run with asserts - all should pass - pass the -ea arg to the VM.  Modify 'Run Configurations' in JBDS for that class.
Note timings
If all runs as expected, all that shows in console out is the timings
