Lab 4
Open up benchmark.xml located at Radargun/conf
Modify benchmark.xml accordingly (just use infinspan xml files)
Run bin/master.sh (note that you must run from Radargun root, otherwise you will get an exception)
Run bin/master.sh -status to make sure master is running
Start the slaves (number defined in standalone.xml)
	bin/slave.sh -p 0
	bin/slave.sh -p 1
	bin/slave.sh -p 2
	bin/slave.sh -p 3
	NOTE -p flag makes it so each slave will have its own log
And the test is running.  tail radargun.log
Test may take a few minutes to run (15 minutes on my laptop with 4 slaves and 5000 requests per slave. Watch logs for completion - 
	You will see a 'master process shutting down message'
NOTE - this test is intense - don't plan on doing anything while it runs
Reports are generated in reports folder.  They are .png files

	If you want to build - clone repo and run mvn install from root
