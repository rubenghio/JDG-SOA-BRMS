Lab 1 - Detailed (or at least more detailed) Steps
Open up JBDS, create new workspace
File -> Import maven project, search to Labs folder
JBDS is now ready

To configure new cache
open up JDG_Server/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml
Add the following:
	<local-cache name="RESTcache" start="EAGER"/>
Start the JDG server
In server log (JDG_Server/standalone/log/server.log) you should see the name of your cache as being enabled

Back in JBDS, you will fill in the following methods
	addFivePiecesOfDataWithPut
		be sure to set the TTL.  If you need help on the header name, hit http://localhost:8080 to see the REST quick reference
		Offset each insert TTL  (30, 60, etc)
	addOnePieceOfDataWithPost
	removeCache
Run code on server
In System out you should see
	5 posts executed along with 200 status for each
	How long the 5 inserts took
	
	The next post tries to post to an existing key.  You should see a 409 conflict error
	
	Then 5 GETS to show the values of the data in the cache.  This repeats with delays (based on the TTL time). This should show the values of the cache timing out and leaving
	You should start seeing exceptions as queries for timed out caches hit
	
	Finally you will see the call to delete the cache and a return code of 200
	
	As the cache is dropped at the end, if you run this multiple times without restarting JDG, you should be fine.
